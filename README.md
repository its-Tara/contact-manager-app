This project is part of my learning journey in React.
 It was created as part of a course/tutorial to reinforce fundamental concepts and gain hands-on experience in React. Through this project, I strengthened my understanding of javascript and gained practical experience in React. It allowed me to apply theoretical knowledge to real-world scenarios, enhancing my problem-solving abilities. Feel free to explore the code and provide feedback. I'm always eager to learn and improve!
